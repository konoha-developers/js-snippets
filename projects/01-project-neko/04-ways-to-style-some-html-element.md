# 4. Ways to style some html element

As we seen before that we use css to style any html element. So the basic idea behind styling anything on the webpage is as follows -
1) Use css rule to target any html element and set some css properties on it. 
2) Generally html elements are given classes, ids, etc. which can be used to select(target) the element using css selectors.
3) After selecting the html element we set a group of properties on that html element. Like **color, background, text-align, border, etc.** are some of the basic properties. This is a good resource to get started with using css https://www.w3schools.com/css/.
4) Many of the developers use css as they start making projects. There is no need for you to learn something for hours to get started using css. Many developers just google the required properties as they need it(for ex. how to center a div meme ? remember it ? it's real and effective approach for beginners but just try to understand what's happening when you get some css rule from the internet). Obivously, once you start making more projects you would remember most of the things by yourself and develop logic to write better css.

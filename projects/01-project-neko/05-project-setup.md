Refer [this](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/changing-the-default-branch) article to change your default branch.

### For beginners the folder üìÅ structure has been opinionated.

1) You are given the html file named `index.html` where you can write your html, `index.css` file inside `styles` folder where you can write your css, `main.js` file inside `scripts` folder where you can write your javascript, a folder named asset to put your website assets like images, etc. You are free to modify this folder structure in any way you like.

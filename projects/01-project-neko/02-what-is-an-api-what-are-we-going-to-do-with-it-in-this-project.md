# 2. What is an API ? What are we going to do with it in the project ?

### API

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is basically a connection between computers or computer programs.
Checkout this 3:24 minutes long [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY)(recommended) or read [here](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api) to actually understand an api as a beginner to api's.

### How are we gonna use an API for this project ?
We will be using an api or apis for fetching data related to cats. There are some api's available publicly which provides us with this cat data. Using these apis we would bring and show the data on our website. 

### These are the apis that we are going to use for the project -
1) *`Documentation`* - [Cataas(Cat as a service api)](https://cataas.com/#/)  
Visit this [link](https://cataas.com/cat?json=true) to actually see the example of data provided instead of documentation.

2) *`Documentation`* - [Cat Facts api](https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/docs/)   
Visit this [link](https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts/) to actually see the example of data provided instead of documentation.

Data fetching from Api will be explained in the next markdown file. Also both of the of api's shown above are used to fetch data in this [simple example website](https://konoha-developers.github.io/project-neko/) for project neko. The code used for fetching data from above apis can also be found [here](https://github.com/konoha-developers/project-neko/blob/3b0ae6ee05035eb1e3cfe2a23f3c726d95f67907/scripts/main.js#L22).


For more such public api's [this](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) github repo is a good resource.
